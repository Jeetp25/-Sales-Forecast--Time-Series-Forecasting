Sales forecasting involved employing a variety of quantitative methods, including Time Series Models and Causal Models, to predict product sales from the dataset. The project aimed to:

Conduct time series analysis to comprehend data patterns and trends.
Utilize multiple forecasting models on the training dataset.
Ultimately, identify the most effective model for forecasting sales and apply it to the test data.
The models explored in the project encompassed the Seasonal Naive Model, Holt-Winters Model (Triple Exponential Smoothing), ARIMA Model alongside Seasonal ARIMA Models, and the Linear Regression Model.

After thorough evaluation, it was observed that the Linear Regression Model surpassed other time-series models in performance. Consequently, for this dataset, employing a regression model for sales forecasting proved more advantageous than traditional time-series models. This preference was underpinned by the dataset's highly seasonal nature and linear trend, aligning well with the assumptions of regression models, which rely on historical data patterns persisting into the future.
